In this folder, you can find a variety of examples to help you get started in using go-libp2p. Every example as a specific purpose and some of each incorporate a full tutorial that you can follow through, helping you expand your knowledge about libp2p and p2p networks in general.

## Troubleshooting

When building the examples ensure you have a clean `$GOPATH`. If you have checked out and built other `libp2p` repos then you may get errors similar to the one below when building the examples. Note that the use of the `gx` package manager **is not required** to run the examples or to use `libp2p`.
```
$:~/go/src/github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-examples/libp2p-host$ go build host.go
# command-line-arguments
./host.go:36:18: cannot use priv (type "github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-crypto".PrivKey) as type "gx/ipfs/QmNiJiXwWE3kRhZrC5ej3kSjWHm337pYfhjLGSCDNKJP2s/go-libp2p-crypto".PrivKey in argument to libp2p.Identity:
        "github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-crypto".PrivKey does not implement "gx/ipfs/QmNiJiXwWE3kRhZrC5ej3kSjWHm337pYfhjLGSCDNKJP2s/go-libp2p-crypto".PrivKey (wrong type for Equals method)
                have Equals("github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-crypto".Key) bool
                want Equals("gx/ipfs/QmNiJiXwWE3kRhZrC5ej3kSjWHm337pYfhjLGSCDNKJP2s/go-libp2p-crypto".Key) bool
```

To obtain a clean `$GOPATH` execute the following:
```
> mkdir /tmp/libp2p-examples
> export GOPATH=/tmp/libp2p/examples
```

### Tests
`go test ./...` will run all tests in the repo
